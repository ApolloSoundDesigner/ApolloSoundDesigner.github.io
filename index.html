								<p>My names Sam but when releasing my work I go by the name "Apollo". I am a Bristol based creator and have grown up around the area. 
									 I have been creating music since I was 14 and furthered my education in the field through GCSEs and College, having also recently attended university.
									 My focus is on sound design and music for visual media such as games, films and tv shows. My main focus so far has been on horror games as well as creating audio for
									 analog horror videos on websites such as Youtube. My current big project is an untitled VR game which is allowing me to experiment with styles due
									 to the game being quite open on genre at the moment. 
									  On this website you can find all my previous work as well as what projects I am currently working upon with ways to contact me.</p>

								<p>Some of my previous work includes releasing an EP, creating sound and music for an upcoming VR game and gaining some experience from a podcasting company.
									My current work revolves around me working on an untitled upcoming VR maze game which involves the player guiding a little character known as Joe Jeff.
									This has also pushed me stylistically due to the games cartoon art style but darker emotional themes.
									 This has also allowed me to learn more about the gaming industry which is something I have been very passionate about for a while it has also
									 allowed me to develop my skills in the game engine as well as learning new audio engines such as FMOD
									  which are key skills in the area of work I do. I have also been at university for nearly three years studying creative music technology
									where my confidence and skills in the practise have nearly doubled. I have also began working with different groups on indie games with
								the most notable being an untitled VR game but also working on a 2D dungeon crawler. These have helped me understand better what it's like 
							to work in the gaming industry. </p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/daw for portfolio.PNG" alt="" /></span>
									 <p>Here is a way to see behind the curtain and is also a way to explain my older releases and my aims when creating them.</p>
									 <p>My Lofi EP was one of my first major university projects and really
										allowed me to creatively push my boundaries as well as gaining me valuable experience in promoting my own work via social media. The overall target
										with this ep was to progress my mixing and mastering skills which at the time
										was a huge success for me but looking back now there are definitely things I would have chosen to do differently. Such as how I would balance the levels.
										as well as use of automation and unique effects. </p>
									 <p>My second major release was the blinding lights remix and this was my first remix. I attempted to play around with the stems and see if I could add a different
										feel to the track. My main effort was to just play around with high level stems and just attempt to cut and stick different stems together
										to help create a new feel to the track. </p>
									<p>My third major release was a mashup of songs by Dua Lipa and Harry Styles and my main aim with this was to focus on mixing vocals as well as using Pan and automating it
										as this is not something I typically do with my work and was an area I wanted to improve on. I found that the track really helped me to learn more about
									mixing vocals as well as creative uses of panning which helped create a new vibe for the track. </p>	
									<p>My next major release will be a collection of music from an upcoming VR game that I am working on. The aim for these songs is to capture the emotion
										and style of the game. For this, I am working closely with the artist and the games director so that I can better understand the feel of the game.
									I am also using a full orchestra kit for the music and I have also been put in charge of the sound design which is helping me gain expereince in this field
								of creating new sounds that I wouldn't have created before. </p>
